        <p>How to make a caramel apple</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>green apple</li>
            <li>wooden stick</li>
            <li>hot drizzly caramel in all its glory</li>
            <li> cooking paper</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Shove a small wooden stick into the core of
                an apple, making sure that enough stick is 
                still outside of the apple so as to serve as a
                handle. 
            </li>
            <li>Holding the stick, smoother the apple in the hot
                caramel until the apple is completely and 
                thoroughly covered, then place the apple stick-up
                on a small piece of cooking paper. 
            </li>
            <li>Let the caramel apple cool for about 10 minutes
                before eating.
            </li>
        </ol>
